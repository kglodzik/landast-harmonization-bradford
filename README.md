# Landsat Harmonization for Bradford Forest

This repository contains R script and reflectance data used in Deljouei et al. (in revision) to generate correction equations for harmonizing NIR and Red surface reflectance values across Landsat 5, 7, and 8, using Landsat 7 as a bridge. Although Landsat Collection 2 has improved cross-sensor calibration by NASA/USGS, we found implausible increases in Leaf Area Index (LAI, which is derived from NIR and Red) in our study area when transitioning from Landsat 5 to 8. The goal of this script was to enable consistent time series analysis of LAI in Bradford Forest, Florida, across the Landsat 5-8 period of record.

The provided reflectance datasets contain NIR and Red band values at randomly generated points used in the Deljouei et al. (in revision) analysis, which were our data inputs for the R script. They are provided here as example input to allow users to easily test the script.

## Contents

### /R_Script/
- `Landsat_Harmonization_Analysis.R`: R script to clean, analyze, and harmonize reflectance values from time-matched Landsat images.
- `Landsat_Matched_Dates.xlsx`: List of image acquisition date pairs used in the harmonization.
- `sample_data/`: Extracted Red and NIR reflectance values at randomly located sample points (for testing or replication).

### Google Earth Engine (GEE) Script
The imagery used in this analysis was gathered and filtered using a GEE script. This script:
- Loads cloud-free Landsat 5, 7, and 8 surface reflectance imagery
- Matches acquisition dates within ~8 days
- Exports Red and NIR bands for further analysis

You can view the GEE script here:

## Reproducing the Analysis

1. Run the GEE script linked above to export Red and NIR bands for each Landsat sensor.
2. Generate random sample points within your study area (we used 350-meter spacing to reduce autocorrelation).
3. Extract Red and NIR values for those points using ArcGIS or similar GIS software.
4. Use the R script in this repository to clean, visualize, and harmonize the reflectance values.
